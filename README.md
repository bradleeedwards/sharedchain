sharedChain, powering a new society
====================================
## Blockchains for the masses secured with social proofs

The Bitcoin blockchain provides a decentralized ledger. The integrity of the blockchain is protected by a mining process that consumes huge amounts of computing resources. A small fraction of the people providing the resources, determined by luck, are rewarded with newly mined Bitcoins. Though not entirely efficient or simple it works perfectly for the purposes for which it was intended, namely to support decentralized payments.

Almost since inception people have been trying to take advantage of various features of the Bitcoin blockchain for other purposes. Some of these attempts are innocuous, others may be the biggest danger Bitcoin faces.

What if there was a way to implement those features and actually benefit Bitcoin?
What if complex rules could be implemented and enforced by the blockchain?
What if you could store objects of any size on the blockchain?
What if the costs were a frac1tion of using Bitcoin?


All of that and more is the promise of the SharedChain. 
A blockchain for the masses secured by social proof, powering a new society.

The Power of Sharing
--------------------
There is a strongly demonstrated need to utilize decentralized blockhain technology for non-monetary applications.
 
Programmable Transactions
-------------------------
Powerful smart transaction support comes from Rubric technologies.

Encrypted Object Storage
------------------------
Large objects can be stored and securely related to entries in the shared blockchain.

SubChain Technology
-------------------
An unlimited number of sub-chains can be supported on top of the SharedChains. These sub-chains can enforce their own transaction logic. This allows new business and organizations to quickly develop new business ideas that require a secure blockchain. 

Bitcoin Integration
-------------------
Bitcoin can be used to pay for any transaction in the SharedChain.
