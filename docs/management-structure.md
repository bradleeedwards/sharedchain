# SharedChain Decentralized Management Structure
The SC is managed by:
1. The SC developers, this is in the end a software product and developers must have a strong voice.
2. The Service owners, they want to ensure the health of the chain
3. The Entities have a lesser voice per link becasue they have a much smaller individual investment
